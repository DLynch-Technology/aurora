This documentation provides information on the major functionality of Aurora, a web application that receives, virus checks, and validates transfers of digital archival records, and allows archivists to appraise and accession those records. 


For technical documentation including how to install Aurora, see the README in the master branch of the aurora repository on the [RAC's GitHub site](https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter).
