title:  "Aurora - Viewing Transfers"
---

As transfers pass through validation, appraisal and accessioning processes, Aurora offers users the ability to view detailed information about them singly or aggregate via a transfers page. Recent transfer activity is also available via a dashboard, which serves as a landing page for the application.

## Dashboard

The homepage of Aurora is a dashboard that provides key metrics about transfer activity including related graphs and charts. A context switcher allows users to access the dashboard for either their own transfer activity or their organization's activity. Archivists can switch between dashboards for all active organizations.

## Transfers Page

Aurora provides a searchable, sortable table to view all transfers and information about them. A button allows the download of a CSV file containing the data from the transfer table. Users can view the status of each transfer, which is updated as it moves through the process. There are 9 possible statuses:

1. Transfer Started
2. Transfer Complete
3. Invalid
4. Validated
5. Rejected
6. Accepted
7. Accessioning Started
8. In Accession Queue
9. Accession Complete

### Transfer Details

Aurora enables users to view more details about a particular transfer by clicking on its row in the table. The detail page provides, as applicable:
- Error messages
- Metadata
- Manifest
- Log
- Rights statements
- Appraisal note
