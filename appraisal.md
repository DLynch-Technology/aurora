title:  "Aurora - Appraisal Features"
---

The application allows archivists to review a queue of the valid transfers to ensure they are relevant to the collecting scope before accessioning. The upfront validation provided by Aurora (particularly the BagIt Profile validation) should prevent most out-of-scope records from being received, but this step allows a manual check by users with the appropriate permissions (see Users section) who will:

1. View transfer details
2. Add an appraisal note (optional)
3. Accept or reject transfers
