Once transfers have been accepted in the appraisal queue, they are moved to the accessioning queue, where multiple transfers can be grouped together into a single accession if they have the same organization, record creators and record type. Archivists with the necessary permissions can create accession records, which represent data about one or (usually) more transfers.
